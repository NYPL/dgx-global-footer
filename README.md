# NYPL New Footer Codebase

This repository is the codebase to set new Footer on NYPL's landing pages.

### Version


### Installation
No install needed. Just run python simple http server.
```sh
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

### Usage
Copy all the contents in footer.html and the styles in _footer.scss, and put in the codebase of landing pages.

Be careful of line 48 in footer.html. There's a js code to automatically generate current year.
It might need to put in proper place based on the structure of landing pages.
